--[[
		Darklands: Tales from Transylvania
		
		An undead invasion threatens the kingdom of Wallachia- as a Moldavan outlander, you must find and dispel the
		dark curse from the land.
		
		This file contains the header, onInit methods and any specific features you want your game to hvae that are not
		provided in the standard RPG- overwrites of the interface etc.

--Note: throughout the script several "print" statements have been scattered to demonstrate progress. 
--These are nonessential, but useful for error detection.

--A simple single town, with a single quest giver and two storefronts, as well as one random NPC.
--This demonstrates the primary features of writing a town script, and a simple dungeon with quest queues.
