		Darklands: Tales from Transylvania
		
		--Fighter
		You are still but a young squire, consripted into the service under the command of Lord Klint, a
		Moldavian defector and an arrogant, cruel man. When he was not slaughtering men from whichever
		side appeared most likely to succeed, he was punishing his servants with the lash with almost
		sadistic pleasure.
		
		When first the call came for a scout amongst the ranks, embittered by your evil master, you rushed
		at all speed from your quarters to volunteer. There's no evil below that could stand toe to toe
		with what you have suffered through, and you are immediately conscripted.
		
		--Theif
		Profit always follows war, or so it's said. The life of an urchin in peace time is difficult and
		wearisome, but in war, where corpses lie where they fall, along with their purses and satchels,
		a young man can make good of himself, if only for a spell. So you have spent your youth, hiding
		in shadows and picking from the bones of conflits between those greater than yourself.
		
		So you had hoped would be the case with this latest invasion, but after weeks of hard travel shadowing
		the invasion force not so much as a drop of blood had been spilled. Starving and desparate, you
		made an attempt on a supply trailer, but the soldiers were too quick, and the rest of the journey
		you spent in chains. When the call came out for a scouting mission almost guaranteed to be suicide,
		it was no surprise to see you finding an audience with the general himself.
		
		--Mage
		Just six months from your training, barely a whelp, your magistrates saw fit to send you to the
		Carpathians in the hopes you would set up a herbarium. Though the first few quiet, contemplative
		weeks are relaxing, you soon find yourself venturing farther and father into the reaches of the
		mountains, to break the monotony.
		
		It is on one of your longer journeys that you come across the soldiers, camping above the ridge in
		an abandoned keep. As a member of the mystics you extend your authority to demand a meeting with the
		general and order him to hault his invasion- but he has other things in mind.
